# Task 1: To-Do List (Python)

This project is part of my **CodSoft Python Programming Internship**.  
The To-Do List application is a simple command-line program that allows users to manage and organize their daily tasks efficiently.

---

## **Features**
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks to a text file so they persist between sessions

---

## **How It Works**
The program displays a menu with options:
1. **View Tasks** — See all tasks (pending and completed)
2. **Add Task** — Add a new task to your list
3. **Mark Task as Done** — Mark an existing task as completed ✅
4. **Delete Task** — Remove a task from your list
5. **Exit** — Quit the program

## **How to Run the Program**

### **Using Python Locally**
1. Clone this repository or download the `task1_todolist.py` file.
2. Open a terminal in the folder where the file is saved.
3. Run the program:
